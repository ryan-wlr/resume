# üîß TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE - DOCX File Issues

## Problem: "Package not found" Error with DOCX Files

**Error Message:** `Package not found at 'C:/Users/ryan_/OneDrive/Documents/brain_surgeon.docx'`

This error occurs when the python-docx library cannot read your DOCX file. This is usually due to:

### üéØ Root Causes
1. **OneDrive Sync Issues** - File is stored in OneDrive and may be locked
2. **File Corruption** - DOCX file may be corrupted or in an incompatible format
3. **Password Protection** - File is password-protected
4. **File in Use** - Microsoft Word has the file open
5. **Permission Issues** - Insufficient file access permissions

### ‚úÖ SOLUTIONS (Try in this order)

#### Solution 1: Copy File Locally (Recommended)
```
1. Navigate to your OneDrive/Documents folder
2. Find the brain_surgeon.docx file
3. Copy it to your Desktop
4. Run the resume optimizer again and select the Desktop version
```

#### Solution 2: Save as Text File
```
1. Open brain_surgeon.docx in Microsoft Word
2. Go to File > Save As
3. Change "Save as type" to "Plain Text (*.txt)"
4. Save as "brain_surgeon.txt"
5. Use the .txt file in the resume optimizer
```

#### Solution 3: Copy-Paste Method
```
1. Open brain_surgeon.docx in Microsoft Word
2. Select all text (Ctrl+A)
3. Copy (Ctrl+C)
4. Open Notepad
5. Paste (Ctrl+V)
6. Save as "brain_surgeon.txt"
7. Use this file in the resume optimizer
```

#### Solution 4: Use Sample Files (Quick Test)
```
1. Run: python demo_quick.py
2. This uses working sample files to test the system
3. Confirms the optimizer works (the issue is just your DOCX file)
```

#### Solution 5: Convert DOCX to TXT (Advanced)
```
python docx_to_txt_converter.py "C:/path/to/your/file.docx"
```

### üéØ Prevention Tips

1. **Store files locally** instead of OneDrive for processing
2. **Save as .txt** when possible for better compatibility
3. **Close Word** before running the optimizer
4. **Check file permissions** if working with shared folders

### ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After trying a solution:
```bash
# Test if your file works now
python browse_mode_fixed.py

# Or run a quick demo to verify the system works
python demo_quick.py
```

### üÜò Still Having Issues?

If none of these solutions work:

1. **Check the file content** - Open it in Word to make sure it contains the job description
2. **Try a different file** - Test with a new DOCX file from Word
3. **Use the sample files** - We provide working sample files for testing
